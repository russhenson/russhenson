# Hi, I'm Russ 👋
I'm a front-end developer with a passion for crafting captivating web experiences. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from De La Salle University, which laid a solid foundation for my technical expertise. However, my hunger for knowledge led me to explore various personal projects, constantly pushing my limits and honing my skills. 

With a combination of bootcamps, self-directed learning, and hands-on experience, I've developed a comprehensive understanding of front-end development. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript frameworks, I'm well-versed in creating engaging web interfaces that leave a lasting impression. 🚀
